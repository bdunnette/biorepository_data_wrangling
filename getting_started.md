# Getting Started 

To get started, make sure you have the necessary tools installed on your computer. You will need:
- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook (for interactive coding and visualization)
- Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis)
- NumPy (for numerical computing)
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (for data visualization)

Windows users can [install Python from the Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NQ7512CXL7T).

Mac and Linux users can install Python using their package manager or download it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, you can install the necessary libraries using pip. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```
pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

Once you have the necessary tools installed, you can start exploring and wrangling biorepository data!
